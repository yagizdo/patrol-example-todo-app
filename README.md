# Patrol Example Todo App

A Flutter Todo application demonstrating the use of Patrol for integration testing.

## 📱 App Overview

This is a simple Todo application built with Flutter that allows users to:
- View a list of todos
- Add new todos
- Mark todos as completed
- Delete todos

The app serves as an example of how to implement Patrol for integration testing in a Flutter application with a clean architecture approach.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with the following structure:

```
lib/
├── constants/       # App-wide constants
├── core/
│   ├── bl/          # Business logic
│   │   └── repositories/ # Repository implementations
│   └── locator/     # Dependency injection setup
├── features/        # Feature modules
│   ├── add_todo/    # Add todo feature
│   │   ├── cubit/   # State management
│   │   └── view/    # UI components
│   └── home/        # Home feature
│       ├── cubit/   # State management
│       └── view/    # UI components
├── models/          # Data models
└── main.dart        # App entry point
```

### State Management
- Uses **BLoC/Cubit** pattern for state management
- Each feature has its own Cubit for managing state

### Dependency Injection
- Uses **GetIt** for service locator pattern
- Services and repositories are registered in the AppLocator

## 🧪 Testing

The app includes integration tests using Patrol:

```
integration_test/
├── add_todo_test.dart    # Tests for adding todos
├── example_test.dart     # Example tests
└── test_bundle.dart      # Test bundle configuration
```
